            <h3>Moving In Together</h3>
            <p>The chaos of boxes everywhere and us trying to build IKEA furniture at midnight. You insisted we could do it without the instructions. Three hours later, we had a bookshelf that looked like modern art, but we were laughing so hard we cried.</p>

            <h3>Cooking Disasters</h3>
            <p>The great pasta incident of 2024. Somehow you managed to burn water, and I set off the smoke alarm making garlic bread. We ended up ordering pizza and eating it on the floor of our half-unpacked kitchen, and it was perfect.</p>

            <h3>Two Years Strong</h3>
            <p>Here we are, two years later, still discovering new things about each other. You still make me laugh every day, still surprise me with your kindness. I can't wait to see what year three brings us.</p>
