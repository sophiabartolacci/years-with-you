            <h3>Our First Date</h3>
            <p>I was so nervous I spilled coffee on my shirt, but you just laughed and said it made me more human. That's when I knew you were special. We talked for hours about everything and nothing, and I didn't want the night to end.</p>

            <h3>Weekend Getaway</h3>
            <p>Our first trip together to the mountains. You insisted on taking the scenic route, and we got completely lost. But watching you navigate with that old paper map, completely determined, I fell a little deeper in love.</p>

            <h3>Summer Picnic</h3>
            <p>The day we spent at the park with homemade sandwiches and your terrible attempt at lemonade. We laid on that old blanket for hours, cloud-watching and making up stories. You said that cloud looked like our future together.</p>
